The total amount of data analyzed assuming 100 frames per second is 0.1 hours
Nonsilence phones as a group account for 100.0% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.1
Overall, lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.1
Phone N accounts for 36.6% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.1
Phone W accounts for 34.9% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.0
Phone T accounts for 17.5% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.0
Phone L accounts for 9.8% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.1
Phone F accounts for 1.2% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.0
