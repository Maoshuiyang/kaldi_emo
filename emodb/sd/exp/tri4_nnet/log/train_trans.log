LOG (nnet-train-transitions[5.5.245~1-9c875]:MleUpdate():transition-model.cc:528) TransitionModel::Update, objf change is 0.234962 per frame over 93400 frames. 
LOG (nnet-train-transitions[5.5.245~1-9c875]:MleUpdate():transition-model.cc:531) 10 probabilities floored, 5 out of 30 transition-states skipped due to insuffient data (it is normal to have some skipped.)
