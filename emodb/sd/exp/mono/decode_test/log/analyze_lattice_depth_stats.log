The total amount of data analyzed assuming 100 frames per second is 0.1 hours
Nonsilence phones as a group account for 100.0% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,2) and mean=1.2
Overall, lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,2) and mean=1.2
Phone W accounts for 32.1% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.1
Phone L accounts for 27.0% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,2) and mean=1.4
Phone T accounts for 22.1% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,1) and mean=1.0
Phone N accounts for 14.9% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,1,2) and mean=1.4
Phone F accounts for 4.0% of frames, with lattice depth (10,50,90-percentile)=(1,2,2) and mean=1.7
